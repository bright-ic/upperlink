# upperlink

upperlink_db_setup.php file was added later on since i didn't remember exporting and committing my database file.
The addition of this file is to make it easier for you to create the database and its table by navigating to the path below
Localhost/root-directory/upperlink_db_setup.php. 
Assuming root-directory is upperlink the Navigate to localhost/upperlink/upperlink_db_setup.php

How To Install

1. Put on your wamp or xampp appache server.

2. Navigate to localhost/upperlink/upperlink _db_setup.php to create the database and tables needed for the program to run.

3. Navigate to localhost/upperlink/ to test the program.

Thanks.
